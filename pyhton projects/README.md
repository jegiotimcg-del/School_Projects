# Python Projects – Student Work Collection

This folder contains Python projects developed by my students as part of their academic learning and practical programming exercises.

The purpose of these projects is to help students:
- Understand basic and intermediate Python concepts
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Gain hands-on programming experience
- Build confidence in software development

Each project is organized in a separate folder and demonstrates different programming techniques such as conditions, loops, functions, and simple applications.
